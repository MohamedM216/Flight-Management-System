‚úàÔ∏è <h2>Flight Management System</h2>

A console-based C++ application that offers a complete flight booking experience with additional features such as user login, itinerary management, and a mock payment system. This project applies Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and uses polymorphism and inheritance for better code design and extensibility. APIs for flight and payment handling are simulated for educational purposes.
üåü <h2>Features</h2>

    User Authentication:
        Login and Sign-up functionality for multiple users.
    Flight & Hotel Booking:
        Users can create custom itineraries by booking flights or flights + hotels.
    Payment Process:
        Mock payment handling for bookings.
    Itinerary Management:
        View, print, and track the history of all bookings.
    User Profile Management:
        Users can view and manage their personal profile details.
    OOP Principles Implemented:
        Polymorphism and inheritance.
        API-like wrappers for flight and payment handling (for learning purposes).
